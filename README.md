# Job Matcher AI

An automated job recommendation and application system based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and semantic vector comparison. It supports GitHub/R2 resume parsing and integrates with platforms like 104 and CakeResume to generate customized cover letters and automate job applications.

---

## üöÄ Features

- NLP-based skill extraction and semantic vector generation (supports Chinese).
- Job vacancy crawling and JSON structured analysis (Python crawler).
- Vector comparison for job recommendation (FAISS / Sentence-BERT).
- ChatGPT-powered automatic cover letter and resume summary generation.
- Golang API integration for platform application behavior (supports .env).
- Cross-platform modular architecture for easy expansion to other job sources.
- Integration with free Microsoft Cloud Partner (MCP) resources (Power Automate, Azure AI).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1.  Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
    CAKERESUME_API_TOKEN=your_token
    GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_id
    ```

2.  Install Python dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Run the main process (recommendation + cover letter):

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

4.  Start the Golang module for application submission (in a separate terminal):

    ```
    cd golang-fetcher
    go run main.go
    ```
